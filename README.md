#Test for Embedded Python

We open the file .py and execute the content through c++. The goal here is to generate an executable file. 

In my experience I have created GUI application in Python and in order to not use the interpreter I have used Pyinstaller to generate an exe file, but it creates a file too large.

So in order to improve the speed of python applications and use a small exe file I have created this test.
